          <h3>Learn How to Program Makeover (3-Day Project)</h3>
          <p>Redesign this site you're reading right now; LearnHowToProgram.com! Do you think a more classic "textbook" feel would be more functional and appealing? What about something more modern and sleek? How would you make it easier to navigate? Should it be more richly-featured? More minimal?</p>
          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <p>Here is the workflow you will follow to adhere to best practices of <a href="#">The Web Design Process</a>, <a href="#">Mobile-First Design</a>, and <a href="#">Design Thinking</a> simultaneously:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Target User Personas and Stories</strong>. Take time and care at this step! As a student at Epicodus, you're in the target audience for this site. This puts you in a unique position to better understand users' needs, and how they use the interface. But don't forget to consider other types of users too! Identify the application's target audience, and all user personas. Record a full list of user stories in your README before advancing.</li>
            <li><strong>Sketches</strong>: Using your user stories as a guide, begin sketching. Create mobile versions of each planned view first, following <a href="#">mobile-first design</a>. Experiment, try different approaches and layouts, discuss thoroughly with your partner, and tweak and rework as necessary. Remember, you should have a fairly finalized layout on paper before wireframing. When you've completed mobile sketches, move on to their desktop equivalents. Then add photographs of paper sketches you're using in the final project to your project repository and README.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireframes</strong>: After both mobile and desktop sketches are finalized, create higher-fidelity digital versions of each in Sketch software. Collaborate with your partner to make decisions about interface details that weren't finalized in the sketches (colors, fonts, etc.) Add both mobile and desktop wireframes to your project repository and README.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototypes</strong>: Then you'll create both mobile and desktop prototypes of your design. Consider how the application will move and respond. Consider navigation; how does . Tweak and experiment as necessary, until you have a prototype you feel confident with. <strong>But don't worry about this yet, we'll cover prototyping in Wednesday's homework!</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Coding</strong>: Finalized prototype in hand, you can begin coding an actual site that reflects the design created in your sketches, wireframes, and prototypes!</li>
            <li><strong>Further Exploration</strong>: If you complete all steps above before the end of Thursday, restart steps for Admin areas described below. Remember, user stories and personas for admins of the site will likely differ from standard users.</li>

        <p class="first-p"><strong>Goal:</strong> This intention of this section is to provide easy access to links and pages that Epicodus students routinely have to return to. From how to set up your .pairs page to how to set up Sass with your CSS, this tab makes the life of the Epicodus student much easier and requires less routine digging around the website.</p>
